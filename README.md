In this project, I migrated covid-19 data from an online repository, transformed it and loaded it into a data warehouse of my choice. I used cron to ensure the data is being updated every week into the data warehouse.

The tools used for this pipeline are;
Python
Docker
Apache Airflow
Cron
PostgresSQL
Metabase
